EF Fall Hack Hackathon - Fishing Vessel Expedition Copilot


The pitch was essentially to create an agent that plans fishing expeditions, saving large fishing corporations millions. We built a ship trajectory model, two fishing population models, and an LLM/agent that could access these models and weather data to help plan journeys. We came up a slightly dodgy algorithm we called 'Trident' to simplify this optimisation problem for the hackathon.
