EF Fall Hack Hackathon - Fishing Vessel Expedition Copilot
Pitch was basically to create a agent that plans fishing expeditions, saving large fishing corps millions. We built a ship trajectory model, 2 fishing population models and a llm / agent that could access  these models / weather data to help plan your journey. An slightly dodgy algorithm we called 'trident' was used to to make this optimisation problem easier.
